Project Title: ACME Data Analysis using IBM SPSS Modeler



#Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze the ACME dataset using IBM SPSS Modeler to identify customer spending behavior, segmentation patterns, and potential overspending trends.


---

Tools Used:

IBM SPSS Modeler – for visual data mining and predictive modeling.

.DAT file – as the source dataset for analysis.



---

Process Overview:

The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology — consisting of Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment phases.

1. Data Import:

The dataset ACME data part 1.dat is imported into SPSS Modeler as the primary source.



2. Data Preparation:

Type Node: Defines field roles and measurement levels (e.g., continuous, categorical).

SetToFlag Node: Converts categorical fields into binary (flag) variables for analysis.

Difference Node: Calculates the difference between credit limit and amount spent.



3. Feature Creation:

CREDITLIMIT_Dollar and AMOUNT_SPENT_Dollar variables are compared to generate new features like DIFFERENCE_CL_AS_Dollar.

Additional flags such as SPENT_TOO_MUCH and SEGMENT are created to classify customer behavior.



4. Analysis and Segmentation:

Customers are segmented based on their spending habits and credit utilization patterns.

Gender-wise analysis is performed to observe spending differences.



5. Output Visualization:

Multiple Table Nodes display processed data and results at each step.

Key metrics and segments are visualized for business insights.

Results & Insights:

Identified customers who exceeded their credit limits (SPENT_TOO_MUCH).

Segmented customers based on spending patterns and demographic factors like gender.

Derived potential insights for improving credit limit policies and customer targeting strategies.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how IBM SPSS Modeler can be used to perform data preparation, feature engineering, and behavioral segmentation using a visual workflow without coding. The resulting insights help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve customer management and financial policies.
